        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
